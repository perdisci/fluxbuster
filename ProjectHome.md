## Fast Flux Network clustering and classification ##

Flux-Buster is a tool that allows for detecting **fast flux networks** via large-scale passive DNS monitoring. Currently, Flux-Buster can analyze "live" passive DNS data provided by the [ISC Security Information Exchange](https://security.isc.org/) infrastructure.

You can find more technical details in [this paper](http://code.google.com/p/fluxbuster/downloads/detail?name=FluxBuster-TDSC.pdf)
